      <description>&lt;p&gt;So one fine day our designer decided that the trees in &lt;a href=&#34;http://summercatchers.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Summer Catchers&lt;/a&gt; are boring. And he was actually right because they were totally static.&lt;br /&gt;
After full day of work he presented a brand new version of tree crowns which were steadily swaying in the light wind. A real breath of fresh air in the visual aesthetics of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#39;position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; max-width:640px; max-height:480px; margin: 0 auto&#39;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#39;https://gfycat.com/ifr/ajarordinaryjaguarundi?hd=1&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; scrolling=&#39;no&#39; width=&#39;100%&#39; height=&#39;100%&#39; style=&#39;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;&#39; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;But then I checked how this was achieved. My breath was taken away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minimizing the build size of your game is always a plus: it saves your disk space, it saves your time to upload and your players&amp;rsquo; time to download, besides some app stores and shops impose size limits. So that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things which I was doing while porting &lt;a href=&#34;http://summercatchers.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our game&lt;/a&gt; to Nintendo Switch (it&amp;rsquo;s worth nothing that this optimization and improvement is applicable to other platforms as well).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
